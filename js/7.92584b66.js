Of course, saddly, that isn't guaranteed dear people. But today we are telling the international community that there is a border issue, and we are pulling back, we're leaving and generally there are no Armenian soliders and no Azeri soldier [in the areas we are leaving]. Then we will bring in international observers and looking at the documents we will determine where the border is. By the way, let me say this as well, my dear people, they tell me not to say this, but why should I say this? We aren't stealing anything. Now, there has a lot of talk about Sev Lake. Soviet Union [era] maps were published and we all saw that in the upper portion [of the lake] the border passes through the water, 20% to 30%. Do we now admit it or not?. Now lets understand, let's study the situation and see if it is really that way, should we say \"fine\" or should we say \"no\" we are going to start a war for 30% of Sev Lake. No, that isn't going to happen. No, we aren't going to escalate the situation, we are going to solve the situation peacfully, and I have published the formula. One of the Co-President countries has given a preliminary response to the formula, and I am hopeful that the other two Co-President countries will also give their reply. And this [proposed formula] could turn into a reality today. Over the course of a week... in a few days you can pull back the troops.
